## Description 
I created this project to help you with your everyday reminders. I used JS, CSS and HTML.
To create a new note, simply click the 'Add' button. Then, select a relevant category and jot down the information you want to remember. If you want to delete a specific note, just click on the 'X' icon. For a clean slate, you can remove all notes at once by using the 'Remove All' button.
