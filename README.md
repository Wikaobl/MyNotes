## Description 
I created this project to help you with your everyday reminders. I used _JS_, _CSS_ and _HTML_.

To create a new note, simply click the **'Add'** button. Then, select a relevant **category** and jot down the information you want to remember. If you want to delete a specific note, just click on the '**X**' icon. For a clean slate, you can remove all notes at once by using the '**Remove All**' button.

## Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wikaobl/MyNotes
```

Next, install dependencies

```bash
cd MyNotes
npm install
```

Run the project

```bash
npm run
```

After successfully starting the project, open your web browser and go to the specified URL http://localhost:3000
